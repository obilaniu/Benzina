In much of the work in the field of machine learning and deep learning, a bottleneck exists in the dataloading phase itself. This is becoming increasingly recognised as an issue which needs to be solved.

Benzina aims to become a go-to tool for dataloading large datasets. Other tools exist, such as `Dali <https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/sdk/dali-developer-guide/docs/index.html>`_. Yet Benzina concentrates itself on two aspects :

* Highest level of performance for dataloading using GPU as loading device
* Creation of a generalist storage format as a single file facilitating distribution of datasets and useful in the context of file system limits.


Further feature points
======================

* Generalist DNN framework methods provided to integrate Benzina to PyTorch and TensorFlow
* Command line programs will be created to assist in Bezina - compatible datasets
* API interface to interact with Benzina
