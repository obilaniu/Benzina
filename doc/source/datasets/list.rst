Dataset Composition
-------------------

A Benzina dataset is, in essence, an indexing over a concatenation of inputs,
targets and possibly filenames with indexing

Dataset's Input Structure
-------------------------

A Benzina dataset's input can also be structured using the mp4 format. It is roughly
the same as the dataset's structure with the differences that *mdat* will contains the
raw concatenation of a single input, its target and possibly filename.

ImageNet 2012
=============

This is the first dataset created for Benzina. It includes the following preprocessing
of the images:

* Resize the image to have its smallest edge be of length 512

Dataset Composition
-------------------

The dataset is composed of a train set, followed by a validation set then a
test set for a total of 1 431 167 entries. The targets and filenames are provided
for each seats:

* | **Train set**
  | Entries 1 to 1281167 (1 281 167 entries)
* | **Validation set**
  | Entries 1281168 to 1331167 (50 000 entries)
* | **Test set**
